## Hi, I'm Preston! ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate frontend developer from Germany with experience in Angular, TypeScript, and JavaScript.
I help designers and companies bring their ideas to life, with a strong focus on future-proof, project-oriented solutions.

Thanks to my previous experience as a musician, I work with discipline and develop creative, precise solutions. I look forward to bringing my skills and ideas to challenging and sustainable projects.

If you think I would be a good fit for your projects, I would be happy to hear from you!
